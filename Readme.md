### Todo:
 - Limit/bump switches
 - Wire up tool heads
 - Automate paths and operation

### Done:
 - The Team tightened up Farmbot and made sure nothing was loose, we then connected farmbot up to a mobile network to make sure 
all the parts worked. after fiddling around with the farmbot interface, we go it to move.
 - 3d printing of weather resistant parts 99 percent complete.
